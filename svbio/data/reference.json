  "text": "Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as Gefitinib (Iressa ™), Erlotinib (Tarceva™), and Aftabinib (Gilotrif™) have been shown to be effective in patient tumors harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations [PMID:123,TITLE:Treatments for EGFR mutations] [PMID:1234,TITLE:Further Treatments for EGFR mutations]. EGFR p.L858R is a common EGFR sensitizing mutation in non-small cell lung carcinoma [PMID:4321,TITLE:EGFR p.L858R in NSCLC]. EGFR T790M confers resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors Gefitinib (Iressa ™), Erlotinib (Tarceva™), and Aftabinib (Gilotrif™)[PMID:932,TITLE:TKI resistances]. The EGFR p.T790M mutation is typically due to acquired resistance to TKI therapy, such as Erlotinib and Gefitinib, and has been reported to arise in more than 50% of patients with disease progression after initial response to Erlotinib [PMID:8732,TITLE:Clinical studies with Erlotinib][PMID:8733,TITLE:Clinical studies with Gefitinib]."
